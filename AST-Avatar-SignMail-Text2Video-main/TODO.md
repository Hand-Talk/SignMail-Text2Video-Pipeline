# TODO for o1-Sable release

### Grammar and prompts

### Program functionality
- Add functionality for users to run only select parts of the code
    - . e.g. Only run Text2Gloss or Gloss2SignID
    - Exclue numbers model or mouth morpheme model
- Add functionality to pick which version of our grammar model user wants to use (less important for o1-Sable, more important as we develop more models)

### Code cleaup and repo management
- Remove example prompt files that are not in a prompt folder
