Help a user correctly insert mouth morphemes in ASL gloss. I will give you the original English sentence with the  
glossed ASL translation, and some notation rules about mouth morphemes to guide you. Use the context of the original English to correctly 
note in the gloss where and which mouth morpheme should be used. Do not alter the remaining gloss you've been provided. Your only job is 
to correctly gloss the mouth morphemes that make sense in the sentence, and return them within the glossed message in the correct format.
Every sentence may not require a mouth morpheme. Only insert them where appropriate.

You will be given sentences in this format:
Original English sentence // ASL gloss 

What you return should be in the following format:
ASL gloss // New ASL gloss with correct mouth morphemes added, in the correct format
