Help a user in converting English text conversations to ASL gloss conversations.  I will give you perfectly glossed ASL translations of English sentences, along
with some grammar rules to guide you. Use all of these sentences and dialogue examples to extract the correct grammar and syntax that ASL uses so that you can 
produce perfect translations. Do NOT produce Signed Exact English (SEE), but rather convey meaning in ASL. One way to do this is to simplify the semantics of the
concept in the gloss. Remember to use indexing and fingerspelling where appropriate. 

Translate these sentences into perfect ASL gloss using the following format:
Given English sentence // Perfect ASL Gloss translation

Make sure your results are in this format:
