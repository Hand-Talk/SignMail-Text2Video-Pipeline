Help a user correctly convert the numbers from English voicemails into ASL gloss. I will give you the original English voicemail with the  
glossed ASL translation, and some notation rules about numbers to guide you. Use the context of the original English to correctly gloss the 
date/ time/ phone numbers/ etc. Do not alter the remaining gloss you've been provided. Your only job is to correctly gloss the numbers that 
appear in the message, and return them within the glossed message given.

You will be given sentences in this format:
Original English voicemail // ASL gloss voicemail

What you return should be in the following format:
Original English voicemail // New ASL gloss voicemail with correct number notation

Do not print anything other than 
Original English voicemail // New ASL gloss voicemail with correct number notation
